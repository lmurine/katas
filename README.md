# The Kata Bucket

There is not much to it, and I hope it will be a help to others, or at least give you a laugh.  

This simple app will collect and store the code kata's that I (or whomever you choose) complete, with notes on the kata description, tests, and where it ended in the rankings.

## Code Katas
### Multiples of 3 or 5
**Description**

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
